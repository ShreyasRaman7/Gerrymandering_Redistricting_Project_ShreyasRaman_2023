# Gerrymandering Redistricting Project

The Gerrymandering Redistricting Project aims to evaluate the impact of redistricting on incumbency during the 2022 Congressional elections. The project focuses on assessing whether certain incumbents were disadvantaged as a result of the redistricting process and if the political party responsible for redistricting unfavorably impacted incumbents of the opposing party.

## Project Goals
- Evaluate the impact on incumbency during the 2022 Congressional elections.
- Assess if some incumbents were disadvantaged due to redistricting.
- Determine if the political party responsible for redistricting had a negative impact on incumbents of the opposing party.

## Background
During the 2021-2022 period, new Congressional districts were established for most of the 50 states in the US. The history of unfairness in drawing congressional boundaries has raised concerns about the principles of "1-person, 1-vote" and the polarization of the US Congress. Detecting and analyzing unfairness in redistricting has become more sophisticated and challenging, requiring the use of new techniques and algorithms.

## Technical Goals
The project involves building a large and complex system that requires teamwork to integrate multiple components. It utilizes various programming styles and languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Java. The project incorporates database design and development, user interface design, requirements analysis, algorithmic analysis, mathematical thinking, and data analysis techniques.

## System Architecture
The top-level system architecture consists of the following components:
- GUI (JavaScript): Handles the user interface for data visualization and interaction.
- Server Logic (Java): Manages the backend logic and processing of data.
- DB: Stores and manages the project's data.
- Data Population (Python): Populates the data sources and prepares them for analysis.
- Data sources: Provide the necessary data for the analysis.
- SeaWulf (Python): Utilizes the computing power of SeaWulf for computationally intensive tasks.

## Importance and Relevance
This project is highly relevant and significant due to its timeliness and the abundance of interesting computer science concepts and technologies involved. Working with multiple languages, databases, algorithms, and real-world software development practices provides valuable learning opportunities and challenges students to tackle a complex problem with a practical application.

Overall, the Gerrymandering Redistricting Project offers a unique opportunity to explore and analyze the impact of redistricting on incumbency, contributing to the understanding of fair representation in the electoral process.
